def introPt1(name):
	return '''Let\'s make your character, ''' + name + '''!
There's a lot that goes into making a character for an RPG, so I recommend setting aside a good chunk of time to do this: 30-60 minutes should be good. I know, that's a long time, but hang in there!

***If you don't have the time right now and need to come back to this later***, type **!cancel**.

So, welcome to Starfinder! In this Fantasy Sci-fi Role Playing Game, you and your party members will embark on a grand journey through the galaxy. If you haven't already, please read through the introductory post in the #ðŸ“•rules channel.

Your character is your manifestation in the world. This character is comprised of not only their abilities in the game, but also their personality and goals! Both one's abilities and their personality are what make this a *role-playing* game. Your character doesn't have to be like you in real life, but they can be if you want!'''

def introPt2():
	return '''Now, start thinking about what kind of character you want to play as. If you don't know where to start, maybe think of some characters from fictional tales that you enjoy, like Spike from Cowboy Bebop, Rocket from the Guardians of the Galaxy, or even Mickey Mouse. You'll be choosing 3 main things that will outline your character:

  - **Race**: The species that your character is. Can range from a **Human** to classic fantasy races like **Elf** or **Dwarf** to an **Android** or even a 4-armed **Kasatha**!
  - **Theme**: The core of your character's motivations. Are you a **Bounty Hunter** or **Mercenary** just looking for the next paycheck, or maybe a **Scholar** or **Priest**? Perhaps you're an **Icon**, a celebrity streaming their adventures to the entertainment channels of the solar system!
  - **Class**: Your character's basis for their heroic abilities. As you gain experience, your abilities granted here will improve, and you will earn more unique abilities as well. Is your character a master **Mechanic**, or perhaps they've channeled the magics of the universe as a **Mystic**?

We're going to go through the available options one step at a time. While some races may be more comfortable playing as certain classes, it's entirely possible to mix and match your choices in any way you'd like!

If you want to see a list of the options ahead of time to help you decide, type **!list race**, **!list theme**, or **!list class** to see those. When you're ready to get started, go ahead and type **!next** please!
