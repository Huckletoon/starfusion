	return '''Let\'s make your character, ''' + name + '''!
There's a lot that goes into making a character for an RPG, so I recommend setting aside a good chunk of time to do this: 30-60 minutes should be good. I know, that's a long time, but hang in there!

***If you don't have the time right now and need to come back to this later***, type **!cancel**.

So, welcome to Starfinder! In this Fantasy Sci-fi Role Playing Game, you and your party members will embark on a grand journey through the galaxy. If you haven't already, please read through the introductory post in the #ðŸ“•rules channel.

Your character is your manifestation in the world. This character is comprised of not only their abilities in the game, but also their personality and goals! Both one's abilities and their personality are what make this a *role-playing* game. Your character doesn't have to be like you in real life, but they can be if you want!'''

def introPt2():
	return '''Now, start thinking about what kind of character you want to play as. If you don't know where to start, maybe think of some characters from fictional tales that you enjoy, like Spike from Cowboy Bebop, Rocket from the Guardians of the Galaxy, or even Mickey Mouse. You'll be choosing 3 main things that will outline your character:

  - **Race**: The species that your character is. Can range from a **Human** to classic fantasy races like **Elf** or **Dwarf** to an **Android** or even a 4-armed **Kasatha**!
  - **Theme**: The core of your character's motivations. Are you a **Bounty Hunter** or **Mercenary** just looking for the next paycheck, or maybe a **Scholar** or **Priest**? Perhaps you're an **Icon**, a celebrity streaming their adventures to the entertainment channels of the solar system!
  - **Class**: Your character's basis for their heroic abilities. As you gain experience, your abilities granted here will improve, and you will earn more unique abilities as well. Is your character a master **Mechanic**, or perhaps they've channeled the magics of the universe as a **Mystic**?

We're going to go through the available options one step at a time. While some races may be more comfortable playing as certain classes, it's entirely possible to mix and match your choices in any way you'd like!

If you want to see a list of the options ahead of time to help you decide, type **!list race**, **!list theme**, or **!list class** to see those. When you're ready to get started, go ahead and type **!next** please!

def racePt1():
	return '''Alright, let's get started! First up is your character's race.'''
	
def racePt2():
	return '''To select a race and learn more about what that entails, type **!race** ***{insert race name here}*** without the curly braces (e.g. **!race Elf**).
You may also view everything online here: <https://www.starjammersrd.com/>'''
	
def racePt3(race):
	return '''If you want to choose **''' + race + '''**, type **!confirm** please! Otherwise, feel free to keep browsing the options with **!race** ***{insert race name here}***'''

def themePt1():
	return '''Now it's time for your character's **theme**! As a reminder, a **Theme** is the core of your character's motivations - their ambitions, goals, and dreams. Another way to think of this could be the favored career path of the character, though this isn't necessarily the case.
	'''

def themePt2():
	return '''To select a **theme** and learn more about what that entails, type **!theme** ***{insert theme name here}*** without the curly braces, just like before. Again, you may also view everything online at <https://www.starjammersrd.com/>'''
	
def themePt3(theme):
	return '''If you want to choose **''' + theme + '''**, type **!confirm** please! Otherwise, feel free to keep browsing the options with **!theme** ***{insert theme name here}***'''
	
def classPt1():
	return '''Alright, on to your **class**! This will determine most of your heroic abilities as you progress through your adventure. As such, there's a lot that goes into these classes - more than I can fit into Discord messages. As such, the overviews here will provide you with the bare minimum of what you need to know to get started, but I'll also provide a link to the reference page for the class if you want to look ahead and see what cool abilities you get as you level up!'''
	
def classPt2():
	return '''To select a **class** and learn more, type **!class** ***{insert class name here}*** - you know the drill.'''
	
def classPt3(classChoice):
	return '''If you want to choose **''' + classChoice + '''**, type **!confirm** please! Otherwise, feel free to look around with **!class** ***{insert class name here}***'''
	
def abilityScore():
	return '''Time to get into some actual numbers - your Ability Scores! Except, not quite yet; we still need to go through any choices that still need to be made about your character that might impact your Ability Scores, like racial dimorphism, the themeless character theme, or the Soldier's key ability score.
	
I've just gotta check to see if you even need to make any of these choices, so hang tight just a second...'''
